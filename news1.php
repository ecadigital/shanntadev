            <h3>The PANDORA story is about a company with a distinctive brand and distinctive products A that in just 
            years has made exceptional.</h3>
            <p>It all started nearly 30 years ago. Back in 1982 a jeweller’s shop that would
            one day become PANDORA was established in modest surroundings in
            Copenhagen, Denmark, by Danish goldsmith Per Enevoldsen and his wife 
            Winnie. From the beginning, they often travelled to Thailand in search of
            jewelry for importing. As the demand for their products increased, their focus
            gradually shifted towards wholesale to clients in Denmark.
            <br><br>

            In 1987, after several successful years as wholesalers, the retail activities
            were discontinued and the company moved to larger premises. Meanwhile,
            the first in-house designer joined the company and PANDORA began focus
            on creating its own unique jewelry. In 1989, the company decided to start
            manufacturing its jewelry in Thailand.
            <br><br>
            Over the following years, PANDORA rapidly expanded its market presence
            from a Scandinavian platform to an international marketing and sales plat
            form driven mainly by third party distributors and strong production capabi
            lities in Thailand.
            <br><br>
            In order to increase its production capacity, PANDORA opened a large scale,
            six-story fully-owned manufacturing facility in Thailand in 2005, which still 
            orms a central part of the current production and infrastructure. In August
            2008 a second manufacturing facility was opened in the same area, which
            in 2010 was followed by the opening of PANDORA’s third and fourth facilities
            in the same area, further strengthening our unique production setup.
