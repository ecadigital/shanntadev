                PANDORA was established in modest surroundings in Copenhagen, Denmark, by Danish gold<br>
                smith Per Enevoldsen and his wife Winnie. From the beginning, they often travelled to Thailand<br>
                in search of jewelry for importing. As the demand for their products increased, their focus gradually<br>
                shifted towards wholesale to clients.</p>
                <p>In 1987, after several successful years as wholesalers, the retail activities were discontinued and<br>
                the company moved to larger premises. Meanwhile, the first in-house designer joined the company<br>
                and PANDORA began to focus on creating its own unique jewelry. In 1989, the company decided<br>
                to start manufacturing its jewelry in Thailand.</p>
